# No orchestration target set, this is an example file.
# Use `launcho target get` and `launcho target set` to edit this.

# Create processes like this:
processes:
  # -
  #   name: "example_proc"
  #   command: ["python", "server.py"]
  #   env:
  #     # Use ${SECRET_NAME} to access secrets defined in the server config.
  #     DATABASE_URL: "${DATABASE_URL}"
  #   # List all services this process should receive traffic from.
  #   # Each service for each process gets allocated a port, which is given
  #   # via a corresponding environment variable, in this case SERVICE_PORT_WEB.
  #   receives:
  #     - "web"
  #   # Define an endpoint to hit to check for health.
  #   health:
  #     service: "web"
  #     path: "/health"
  #   #uid: "whoever"
  #   #gid: "whoever"
  #   #cwd: "/var/wherever"

# Create services like this:
services:
  # -
  #   name: "web"
  #   on: "127.0.0.1:5000"
